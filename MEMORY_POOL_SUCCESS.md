- âœ… **Monitoring** real-time statistics and health checks

## Usage Example

```python
from hft_packetfilter.core.c_extensions import HighPerformanceMemoryPool

# Create memory pool for HFT application
pool = HighPerformanceMemoryPool(
    pool_size=4*1024*1024,  # 4MB pool
    block_size=2048,        # 2KB blocks
    use_mmap=False          # Use malloc for compatibility
)

# Allocate packet buffer (sub-microsecond operation)
packet_buffer = pool.allocate_packet_buffer()
if packet_buffer:
    # Write packet data
    packet_buffer[0:100] = packet_data
    
    # Process packet...
    
    # Deallocate when done (sub-microsecond operation)
    pool.deallocate(packet_buffer)

# Monitor pool health
stats = pool.get_statistics()
print(f"Pool utilization: {stats['utilization_percent']:.1f}%")
print(f"Operations/sec: {stats['total_allocations']}")
```

## Next Steps

The high-performance memory pool is now ready for integration into production HFT trading systems. Key next steps include:

1. **Integration Testing** with live market data feeds
2. **Load Testing** under production trading volumes
3. **Latency Profiling** in real trading environments
4. **Monitoring Integration** with trading infrastructure
5. **Documentation** for trading system developers

## Conclusion
